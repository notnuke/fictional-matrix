First, create the .js file. It'll fail to run with 
node server.js


IN THE ./server/ DIRECTORY:
    Then, install lodash, which creates the node_modules directory, using 
    node install lodash

    Then create a package.json because... just because: 
    npm init

    If we were doing this from the main git repo directory, it would pull the repo name automatically. Now, re-add lodash and save it into package.json.
    node install lodash -S
